## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21G.346 Topics in Modern French Literature and Culture: North America Through French Eyes_ as it was taught by Professor Bruno Perreau in Spring 2014.

This course is a close study of history and criticism of French literature, focusing on a specific group of writers, a movement, a theme, a critical or theoretical issue, or an analytic approach.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

Gain an in-depth understanding of France’s interest in and ambivalent relationship with North American cultures since the eighteenth century using materials drawn from literature, cinema, comics, TV shows, and political debates to explore various themes.

## Instructor Interview

_Below, Prof. Perreau describes some aspects of the course_.

The main challenge for the students and for the instructor in this course is the apparent easiness of the materials. Contrary to other classes where texts are mostly about France, most texts in this class analyze American history and cultural norms. Students thus feel immediately comfortable. However, this requires even more critical thinking for deconstructing categories which seems in the first instance so familiar. The course thus implies a high level of reflexivity. If not, students risk seeing only cultural stereotypes in the transatlantic looking-glass.

### Breakdown by Year

Demographics for this course vary depending on year and schedule.

### Typical Student Background

Students who take the course usually have four main profiles:

- Students who hope to go to France to study or for an internship and want to be prepared with a better understanding of French culture, which is particularly salient in a class that questions both French and American cultures together. In that case, they are more often freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, depending on their level of French and the number of language classes they have attended.
- Students back from work or study in France who wish to keep a certain connection. They are more often seniors.
- Students who have a specific intellectual interest for transatlantic questions. They are more often graduate students in international studies, political science, philosophy, etc.
- Students who have a francophone background and want a new experience of immersion.
